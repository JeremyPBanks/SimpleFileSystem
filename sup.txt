Inode size is 512 bytes (as far as we're concerned)

Note: for read/write operations, use block_read and block_write (see block.c)

1:1 ratio of blocks to inodes

n-indirect inodes will be implicit; indirect pointer goes to another inode struct. Don't differentiate between singly-indiriect, doubly-indirect, etc.

Start of data region = block # 520: 8(Super) + 512(inodes)

ASSUME /tmp/laf224/mountdir will exist as a 'root' in test environment. PUT THIS IN THE README

Add support for indirect inodes; right now we only use direct

To Do Later: +  how do we handle empty blocks in the middle of a file?
	     +  mkdir implementation ~ just call create with small modifications?

Notes for emails:
	-echoing to a file that doesn't exist, right now it creates the file but should it actually write to it???
	-buffer sizes bigger than 4kb, should we be writing the whole thing?
	-check directory permission? If so, where?
	-Should every directory contain its parent?


***Design Decision***:	Keep writing until data is filled (check as we go, not all at once)

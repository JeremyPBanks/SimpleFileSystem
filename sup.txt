Inode size is 512 bytes (as far as we're concerned)

Note: for read/write operations, use block_read and block_write (see block.c)

1:1 ratio of blocks to inodes

n-indirect inodes will be implicit; indirect pointer goes to another inode struct. Don't differentiate between singly-indiriect, doubly-indirect, etc.

Start of data region = block # 520: 8(Super) + 512(inodes)

ASSUME /tmp/laf224/mountdir will exist as a 'root' in test environment. PUT THIS IN THE README

Add support for indirect inodes; right now we only use direct

To Do Later: +  how do we handle empty blocks in the middle of a file?
	     +  mkdir implementation ~ just call create with small modifications?

Notes for emails:
	-how do we handle current directories?
	-DO we have to check if a path is to a file or directory?
	-where is the root path?
	-how does calling creat on an existing file change that file?
	-how tf do we do link counting?
	-what is this trash?
	-how many of the stat struct members do we need to keep track of?
	-bitch u gonna fuck us on cd root u motherfucker i will end u, so many ways to do it
	-we're getting an error for calling touch in terminal, touch: setting times of 'file.c': Function not implemented


***Design Decision***:	Keep writing until data is filled (check as we go, not all at once)


ps -ef | grep sfs
gdb attach 20319
./sfs -s...

Terminal Commands
Traversal: cd
Create File: touch

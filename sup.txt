Inode size is 152 bytes

Note: for read/write operations, use block_read and block_write (see block.c)

1:1 ratio of files to inodes

n-indirect inodes will be implicit; indirect pointer goes to another inode struct. Don't differentiate between singly-indiriect, doubly-indirect, etc.

Start of data region = block # 179: 8(Super) + 171(inodes)

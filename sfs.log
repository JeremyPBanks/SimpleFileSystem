Here is a very long string. Let me talk about the project for a bit. SO, we have been through a lot of nonsense up to this point, but I feel it is finally coming to an end. I beleive that whether or not we can truly call this project finished depends on whether or not this final test case succeeds. The aim of this test case is to determine whether or not problems will arise when a the data blocks belonging to a single file are not all contiguous. To accomplish this, I am writing a long string to one file, then writing that long string to another file. If I can successfully alternate between insertions of the two files, I will consider this experiment a success.
